![The True Meaning of Fall](https://i.imgur.com/qdtRZT0.png)

Sick of hearing about pumpkin spice? This is a Chrome extension that replaces all mention of Starbucks' and others' aromatic orange bullshit with glorious nuggets from Colin Nissan's McSweeney's [ode to decorative gourds](https://www.mcsweeneys.net/articles/its-decorative-gourd-season-motherfuckers).

## Installation

Install it from the [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/the-true-meaning-of-fall/lpjnloocokljhfofjoacinojkgpbnojl).

#### Try it out

Go search `pumpkin spice latte` on google or google news or `#pumpkinspice` on twitter or something.

The extension icon lights up when it's active.

#### Manual installation

Download this repo. Go to [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions), enable developer mode, hit "load unpacked", and select this repo's directory you downloaded. That shit is going to look so seasonal.

## FAQ

#### The grammar is a bit messed up sometimes?

`pumpkin spice` works as both an uncountable noun and an adjectival phrase, so it has quite versatile usage, which is non-trivial to replace with less flexible phrases. [It can be improved](https://github.com/tobek/the-true-meaning-of-fall/issues).

#### Why does the extension require permission to "Read and change all your data on the websites you visit"?

The extension loops through all text on all pages you visit in order to replace it with squashy business. Don't worry, it doesn't fucking do anything else.

#### What season is it?

Itâ€™s fall, fuckfaces.
